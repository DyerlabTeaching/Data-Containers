# Data Containers in R

## Impetus

We rarely work with a single datum and instead work with tons of data. As such, we need to be facile in how we deal with lots of data, how it is stored, and how we can efficiently work with it. In this topic, the basics of the following container types are explored.

-   Vectors

-   Matrices

-   Lists

-   Data Frames

## Student Learning Objectives

This module has the following learning objectives.

### Apply and analyze data container structures

> Learners will correctly construct and manipulate core R data containers (vectors, matrices, lists, and data frames), and evaluate when each structure is most appropriate for storing and analyzing population genetic data.

-   Bloom’s Levels: *Apply* (construct, manipulate), *Analyze* (distinguish, evaluate).

### Integrate data containers into reproducible workflows

> Learners will import, access, update, and export data across multiple container types, developing analysis-ready R objects that support downstream population genetic workflows.

-   Bloom’s Levels: *Apply* (import, edit, export), *Create* (develop workflow-ready structures).

## Content

Content for this topic includes both slides and a longer narrative.

-   [Slides](https://dyerlabteaching.github.io/Data-Containers/slides.html#/title-slide) covering data containers
-   A longer [narrative](https://dyerlabteaching.github.io/Data-Containers/narrative.html) that goes into more depth on each of the constituent container types.
