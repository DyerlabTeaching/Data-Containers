## Examples

This in-class file is used for demonstrating individual examples related to this topic and is kept as a persistent record of examples provided during lectures.

## The Data

There are two data sets used for this example;

-   The *iris* data set (that comes with R) that describes the sepal and pedal sizes on three species of *Iris*. This is a classic data set found in a wide variety of data sets and is a great example of having several sample measurements on several individuals in different groups.

-   Environmental suitability and census data collected by the Dyer lab at various sampling site locales for a species of bark beetle, *Araptus attenuatus* that we will be using throughout the semester. For this creature, we will be using some data I have stored on Google Drive in a spreadsheet. Instead of downloading the data for everyone, I have shared a URL to it where we can get to it in `R` directly. In terms of reproducable research, this is *a good thing.*â„¢

    ```{r}
    url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DyerlabTeaching/Data-Containers/main/data/arapat.csv"
    ```

## Vectors

A vector is a list of elements that **must** be the same class of variable.

## Matrices

Matrices are a collection of data types in a 2- or 3-dimensional configuration, often used for mathematical modeling.

## Lists

Lists are a structure that allows you to have *named* variables. Elements may be of different class and sizes.

## Data Frames

A `data.frame` is a dense data container similar to that of a spreadsheet where each column has data of the same type (e..g, Latitude, or Temperature) and each row represents a single record of measurements taken together (same time, same individual, etc.).
