## The Data

There are two data sets used for this example; The *iris* data set (that comes with R) and data from the following url that has some sampling site locales for a species of bark beetle, *Araptus attenuatus* that we will be using throughout the semester.

For this creature, we will be using some data I have stored on Google Drive in a spreadsheet. Instead of downloading the data for everyone, I have shared a URL to it where we can get to it in `R` directly. In terms of reproducable research, this is *a good thing.*â„¢
