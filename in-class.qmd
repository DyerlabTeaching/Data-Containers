## Examples

<<<<<<< HEAD
This in-class file is used for demonstrating individual examples related to this topic and is kept as a persistent record of examples provided during lectures.

## The Data

There are two data sets used for this example; The *iris* data set (that comes with R) and data from the following url that has some sampling site locales for a species of bark beetle, *Araptus attenuatus* that we will be using throughout the semester.

=======
This file is intended to be used for in-class examples that I provide as part of the lecture. This way, all the example stuff I do can be made available to you. It will be reformatted at the end of the semester so if you want to keep it as examples, do not pull a new version after the class is finished.
